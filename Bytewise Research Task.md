# Bytewise research Task:Exploring Game Design

## Procedural Generation
Procedural generation means the data or the content is generated via a certain logic/algorithm, instead of a human creating the content manually.Procedural generation is put to use in a lot more complex ways like generating graphics for video games. The awesome unending open world games graphics, where there is literally no end to the world, are a result of the procedural generation technique
Gamers love open world games, which literally have no end. Run, drive, trek as far as, as long as you can.It won’t take a genius to figure out that such a massive amount of content cannot be generated manually. It would take years if not decades to launch a game like this.Such games are only possible via procedural generation. The game code generates the environments on the fly as the player progresses through the game,providing an immersive user experience.
### Examples of games that use Procedural Generation:
1.**Minecraft**: one of the biggest games in history uses procedural generation to generate those massive infinite world with different structures,items,resources and mobs for a truly unique player experience everytime a new world is generated.Its the biggest reason for its massive appeal amoung gamers of all ages.

2.**Endless Runners**:Endless runners are a video game genre that use procedurale generation to generate paths,powerups,enemies,obstacles etc most popular of these games are***Subway Surfer***,***Temple Run***,etc

3.**Dwarf Fortress**: This simulation game generates a procedurally generated world with civilizations, history, and geography, allowing players to build and manage their own fortress in a randomly generated world.

## Physics Based Gameplay
In physics based games, the gameplay mechanics involve, well, physics! As the player, you'll probably have to carry things, toss things, jump around, and more. Gamers love these games for their challenge and (usually) their realism.
The best thing about physics based games are that they add an immersive experience to the game. The player get to understand how physics is effecting the player, how the player is going to tackle all the challenges with the provided skills. The player has to make continuous strategies to survive. All of this provides great experience and great curosity to excel further and more.
There are some downsides to it as well:
In order to incorporate physics engine it requires a powerful hardware for game to run smoothly. Also there are limited physics mechanics available in the engines, creating physics mechanics from scratch is certainly challenging, specially for indie game developers. Sometimes it is difficult to learn the physics behaviours in a game at start, which might lead to frustration and uncertainty.
### Examples of games that use Physics Based Gameplay:
1.**Human Fall Flat**:It is a Platforming game where you control a humanoid, blank-faced creature with poor control over its limbs. You'll need to do what you can with your flailing arms in order to solve puzzles and reach the end of the levels.

2.**Fall Guys**:It is a Battle Royale Game where players have to compete against max 60 players accross multiple levels, the gamer controls a jelly-like character with long arms and tiny legs, players have to use the physics based movement to qualify for the next level and to win the game

3.**Angry Birds**:This mobile game uses physics-based mechanics to allow players to fling birds at structures to destroy them, with the trajectory of the bird's flight affected by gravity,wind, and other environmental factors.

## Player Choice and Branching Narratives
In player choice and branching narratives, the player's decisions and choices influence the story and overall direction of the game. The ability to make decisions and choose one's own path increases player engagement and curiosity. It makes the player care more about the outcomes of the story and gives them a feeling of possessing power and independence over decisions.
It allows the player to build different relationships as Commander Shepard with the other characters in the universe, and different characters will react positively or negatively towards Sheperd's decisions, and characters can even live or die, depending on the player’s choices. But Mass Effect doesn’t have skill checks. It gives the player different dialogue options, and the player must choose what they feel is the best option, without knowing the outcome.
### Examples of games that use Player Choice and Branching Narratives:
**The Witcher series**: This RPG allows players to make choices that affect the outcome of the story, with multiple endings based on the player's choices.

**Detroit: Become Human**: This narrative-driven game allows players to make choices that affect the story and relationships between characters, leading to multiple branching paths and endings.

**The Stanley Parable**: This interactive storytelling game allows players to make choices that affect the narrative, with the story branching off into different paths depending on the player's decisions.

## Resource Management and Economy Systems
Game Resource management and economics systems are most integral part of game design.Resource management is about collecting, monitoring, and leveraging quantitative resources with incomplete information. Any game with complex resource management, that offers compelling choices, will involve imperfect decisions, leading to interesting strategy.
### Examples of games that use Resource Management and Economy Systems:
1.**Civilization series**: This turn-based strategy game involves managing resources, research, and diplomacy to build a civilization and achieve victory.

2.**Stardew Valley**: This farming simulation game involves managing resources, crops, animals, and relationships with NPCs to build a successful farm and community.

3.**SimCity**: This city-building simulation game involves managing resources, infrastructure, and services to build and manage a city and its economy.

## Social Mechanics and Multiplayer Interactions
Multiplayer games let the players interact and play with each other. Enhancing the overall gaming experience and develops a sense of community my promoting teamwork and collaboration.
In-game social interaction often takes on the forms of communication with other gamers, guild, and group play Traditionally, deeper social mechanics have been linked to midcore games. But lately, these deeper social mechanics, like co-ops, guilds, and social live events, have started appearing in traditionally single-player genres, like casual puzzle games. In other words, we are seeing more and more mobile games adding spaces where people can interact with each other, no matter the genre of the game.
### Examples of games that use Social Mechanics and Multiplayer Interactions:
1.**AmongUs**: Amoung us is a multiplayer game that has two groups of players(Imposters and Crew memebers) dropped into a space themed map.Imposters have to secretly kill of the crew members one by one while avoiding being caught,while the Crew members have to complete various tasks accross the ship along side finding out who is the imposter.Every time a dead crew member is discovered a meeting is called to discuss who could have done it if they are sure someone is a imposter they can kill him during these meetings.

2.**Rocket League**: This multiplayer game involves players competing against each other in a game of soccer, but with rocket-powered cars instead of human players.

3.**Sea of Thieves**: This multiplayer game involves players cooperating to sail a ship, hunt for treasure, and fight against other pirates on the high seas.
